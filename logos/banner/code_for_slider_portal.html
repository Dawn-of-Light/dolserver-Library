          <div id="p7tpc1_1"><p>- <strong>Storm: Arena</strong>.&nbsp; Storm Arena is an instancing
system where players can set up their own instanced PvP games that others
can join.</p>
<p>- <strong>Arena Battlegrounds</strong>. Arena battlegrounds are just like real battlegrounds except level range and zone can be customized to be whatever we want.&nbsp; Check out the 5 Arena battlegrounds set up for each level range, including a level 50 battleground for concentrated RvR fun.</p>
<p>- Use /event to see active Arenas and XP/RP/BP bonuses, use /info to see a brief overview of Storm.</p>
<p>- You can read the Storm FAQ by visiting any Storm Herald npc.</p>
<p>- 2x XP in PvE zones, 3x XP in RvR zones plus various in game events that boost XP, RP, or BP in designated areas.</p>
<p>- Version 1.95+ supported. Be sure to check out the tutorial zones!</p>
<p>- Hunt the Altlantean artefacts and make them more powerful! Beware of the terrible Atlantis monsters</p>
<p>- An IRC channel, #dolplay in quakenet, from which in-game players may talk via the /irc command.</p>
<p>- Market NPCs allow you to stock up and auction your goods to other players,&nbsp; even when not in game. These can be found in the capital cities.</p>
<p>- Scroll System: NPCs can drop scrolls when slain, which can be used to summon teleporters, merchants and trainers for ease of use.</p>
<p>- Special handling of regeneration to reduce downtimes: when a mob is killed in a PvE zone, you receive 25% endurance and 10% mana.</p>
<p>- Mercenaries can be hired from the Guild of Mercenaries - these helpful followers will either heal, fight or cast at attackers from range. Cannot be used in RvR. Speak to the Mercenary Guild in your capital city!</p>
<p>- Fight alongside your enemies in PvE zones. Outside of New Frontiers and Darkness Falls, all realms are friendly, allowing you to always have company when you level.</p>
<p>- Many 'hidden extras' that enrich your gaming experience; special encounters, hidden mini-games, secret items and rewards.</p></div>
          <div id="p7tpc1_2"><p>- Starting Level: 1</p>
<p>- Option to Instant-50, though this will flag your character as unable to receive and use some items and you will not be able to leave New Frontiers. Speak to the NPCs at your realm's portal keep!</p>
